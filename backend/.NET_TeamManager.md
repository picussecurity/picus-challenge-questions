# Picus Team Manager

In this task, we ask you to implement a desktop application to manage users and teams in a company.

## Wizard Part

The application should run as a 2-step wizard. When the application starts, the user is expected to login into the first wizard page and click `Next`. On the next page, users enter his/her purpose of logging in so that we can check everyone's purpose on each login and track the cause of any unwanted incident. After clicking the `Next` button, the user can access the management system.

## Management Part

There are teams and users in our system. Teams have a name (unique) and creation date fields, and users have name, surname, creation date, phone number, and title fields. Users of the system should be able to add/remove any number of users and teams. You can use additional fields for internal usage.

### Requirements
* We should be able to list teams and users separately.
* We should be able to add users to and remove users from teams. A user can be part of multiple teams.
* In team details, users in the team should be listed.
* In user details, teams of the user should be displayed.
* If there are users in a team, the application should prevent the deletion of that team. Users should be removed from the team before deleting the team.
* We should be able to query users and teams by their name and creation date range.
* We should be able to query users that belong to a team.
* 
### Bonus features
* There should be pagination in user and team lists.
* Lists should be sortable by id or creation date.
* To make it similar to our architecture, we expect you to write a simple web server for CRUD operations. The application communicates with this server, and the server handles data storage.

## Data management

You need to persist data and relations somewhere (file, database, or any other option you prefer) other than memory so that data persists upon application exit.

## Development

We do not restrict frameworks or technologies you use. But we prefer you to use WPF-based MVVM architecture for desktop development. 
If you decide to implement a web server, you can use any technology, however; we prefer you to use Golang if you are familiar with it. Otherwise, you can use .NET as well.

## Submission

Please provide us with a Readme to help us execute your application. You can assume we will execute this code on Windows 10. You can use any free cloud platform to host your server and/or database.

## Evaluation

We will not evaluate this task in a black-box manner. Therefore, if there are any unclear points, you can write your assumption in a comment and implement accordingly.
